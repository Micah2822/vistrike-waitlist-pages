Here’s what your CVAT export shows for this clip (based on the punch + defense action labels, and the per-frame guard/exposure attributes on each fighter). 
default
Blue corner summary (throughout clip)
Offense
Punches thrown: 3 total
2× jab to head (both lead hand): 1 blocked, 1 evaded
1× rear hook to body (setup: touch_jab): blocked
Landed (confirmed): 0
Defense
Defensive actions logged: 4 (all high_guard)
vs uppercut: failed
vs hook (head): failed
vs body shot / hook: unknown outcomes (2)
Pattern: when Red finally steps in with power (uppercut/hook), Blue’s high guard doesn’t stop the shots cleanly.
Exposure / posture (from frame attributes)
Blue spends a lot of time in high/mid guard, but there are stretches where exposure is tagged open/partial/unknown (especially around exchanges), suggesting inconsistent cover or annotation uncertainty.
Actionable training focuses (Blue)
Uppercut + hook defense from high guard: drill “elbows tight + rear hand glued + chin tucked” and add a default answer (catch → roll / catch → step-out).
Stop entering naked: your jab attempts are mostly single, no-setup. Add feints, double-jab, or jab-to-body to earn reactions before committing.
After a blocked shot, don’t freeze: build a simple sequence: jab (blocked) → step off-line → jab again / hook to body.
Body protection on hooks: your only body attempt got blocked—work on changing level without dropping the opposite hand.
Red corner summary (throughout clip)
Offense
Punches thrown: 4 total
1× lead uppercut to head (step_in, inside lane): landed clean (heavy)
1× rear hook to head (combo, outside lane): landed clean (heavy)
2× lead hooks (head/body, combo): result = unknown (likely partial/graze or not confidently tagged)
Landed (confirmed): 2 clean shots (both head, both heavy impact)
Defense
Defensive actions logged: 3, all successful
high_guard vs jab (success)
block_body vs body shot (success)
slip_left vs jab (success)
Pattern: early on, Red is disciplined defensively and shuts down Blue’s basic entries.
Exposure / posture (from frame attributes)
Red shows long stretches where centerline/chin exposure is “open” in the data—often around the later attacking sequence—suggesting that when Red opens up to punch, defensive responsibility drops (counter window risk).
Actionable training focuses (Red)
Keep your defense while you score: you’re landing big, but the clip flags you as open down the middle during offense—drill “punch → bring the hand home / head off-center.”
Add a jab (or feint) layer: most of your offense here is hook/uppercut-based. Add jab → uppercut and jab → rear hook so entries are safer + more repeatable.
Tighten combo endings: your last two hooks are tagged unknown—likely because they’re not clean/clear. Work on distance + placement so shots finish decisively (especially the body hook).
Exploit Blue’s high guard weakness: your best moment is step-in uppercut then hook—make that a repeatable trap after you get Blue shelled up.
Quick “fight story” of the clip (what happens when)
Early exchange (frames ~24–51): Blue probes with jab/body hook; Red blocks/slips everything.
Later exchange (frames ~121–152): Red steps in and lands a clean uppercut + clean hook; Blue’s high guard fails under pressure; Red continues hooking with less-clear outcomes.
